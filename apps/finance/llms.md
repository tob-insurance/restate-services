# Restate

## Docs

- [Cluster health](https://docs.restate.dev/admin-api/cluster_health/cluster-health.md): Get the cluster health.
- [Create deployment](https://docs.restate.dev/admin-api/deployment/create-deployment.md): Create deployment. Restate will invoke the endpoint to gather additional information required for registration, such as the services exposed by the deployment. If the deployment is already registered, this method will fail unless `force` is set to `true`.
- [Delete deployment](https://docs.restate.dev/admin-api/deployment/delete-deployment.md): Delete deployment. Currently it's supported to remove a deployment only using the force flag
- [Get deployment](https://docs.restate.dev/admin-api/deployment/get-deployment.md): Get deployment metadata
- [List deployments](https://docs.restate.dev/admin-api/deployment/list-deployments.md): List all registered deployments.
- [Update deployment](https://docs.restate.dev/admin-api/deployment/update-deployment.md): Update deployment. Invokes the endpoint and replaces the existing deployment metadata with the discovered information. This is a dangerous operation that should be used only when there are failing invocations on the deployment that cannot be resolved any other way. Sense checks are applied to test that the new deployment is sufficiently similar to the old one.
- [Health check](https://docs.restate.dev/admin-api/health/health-check.md): Check REST API Health.
- [Cancel an invocation](https://docs.restate.dev/admin-api/invocation/cancel-an-invocation.md): Cancel the given invocation. Canceling an invocation allows it to free any resources it is holding and roll back any changes it has made so far, running compensation code. For more details, checkout https://docs.restate.dev/guides/sagas
- [Delete an invocation](https://docs.restate.dev/admin-api/invocation/delete-an-invocation.md): Use kill_invocation/cancel_invocation/purge_invocation instead.
- [Kill an invocation](https://docs.restate.dev/admin-api/invocation/kill-an-invocation.md): Kill the given invocation. This does not guarantee consistency for virtual object instance state, in-flight invocations to other services, etc.
- [Purge an invocation](https://docs.restate.dev/admin-api/invocation/purge-an-invocation.md): Purge the given invocation. This cleanups all the state for the given invocation. This command applies only to completed invocations.
- [Purge an invocation journal](https://docs.restate.dev/admin-api/invocation/purge-an-invocation-journal.md): Purge the given invocation journal. This cleanups only the journal for the given invocation, retaining the metadata. This command applies only to completed invocations.
- [Restart as new invocation](https://docs.restate.dev/admin-api/invocation/restart-as-new-invocation.md): Restart the given invocation as new. This will restart the invocation as a new invocation with a different invocation id. By using the 'from' query parameter, some of the partial progress can be copied over to the new invocation.
- [Resume an invocation](https://docs.restate.dev/admin-api/invocation/resume-an-invocation.md): Resume the given invocation. In case the invocation is backing-off, this will immediately trigger the retry timer. If the invocation is suspended or paused, this will resume it.
